# Boosted-Regression-Tree-in-Prediction-with-variable-selection
One Boosted Regression Tree method in  Prediction of Industrial Steam Volume after variable selection 
zhengqi_train.txt is divided into two parts, one as a training set（80%） and the other as a validation set（20%）.   
we use a wrapper method--psovs(Particle Swarm Optimization variable selection) to find the most important independent variable.   
We used Boosted-Regression-Tree as a regression prediction method to predict industrial steam production.   
The predicted results by the mean square error(MSE) as the evaluation standard.
